          <h2>About the Enigma Machine</h2>
          <p>
            The Enigma machine was a cipher device used by Nazi Germany during
            World War II to secure communications. It employed a complex system
            of rotating rotors and plugboard configurations, which created
            millions of possible settings, making it highly secureâ€”until Allied
            cryptographers broke the code.

        <section className="simulation-section">
          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            This simulation allows you to explore how the Enigma machine encoded
            messages. Adjust rotor positions, configure the plugboard, and see
            how each modification affects the encryption process in real-time.
